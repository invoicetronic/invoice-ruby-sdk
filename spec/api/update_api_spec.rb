#Italian eInvoice API

#The Italian eInvoice API is a RESTful API that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed by Invoicetronic to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while still providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. The API also provides advanced features and a rich toolchain, such as invoice validation, multiple upload methods, webhooks, event logs, CORS support, client SDKs for commonly used languages, and CLI tools.  For more information, see  [Invoicetronic website][2]  [1]: https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/sistemainterscambio/cose-il-sdi/ [2]: https://invoicetronic.com/
